<p class="action">TITLE: VO Demo Reel Scripts AUTHOR: Thomas Woodrow DRAFT DATE: 2026-02-12</p>
<p class="action">!<strong>PHARMA</strong></p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Living with chronic pain means making choices every day. What you can do, what you have to skip. Renova was developed to help you reclaim those moments. Talk to your doctor about whether Renova might be right for you.</p>
<hr class="section-break">
<p class="action">!<strong>LUXURY</strong></p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Some things can’t be rushed. The slow cure of leather. The settling of a single malt. The moment you realize you’ve arrived. Not at a destination, but at a standard. Meridian. For those who understand.</p>
<hr class="section-break">
<p class="action">!<strong>AUTO</strong></p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">300 miles of open road. No reception. No schedule. Just the hum of the engine and the kind of quiet you forgot existed. The all-new Traverse. Go find it.</p>
<hr class="section-break">
<p class="action">!<strong>RETAIL</strong></p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">This weekend only. Save up to 40% on everything in store. Furniture, lighting, rugs, all of it. Spring Refresh starts now at Carrington Home.</p>

<p class="dialogue">You taught them to tie their shoes. To ride a bike. To look both ways before crossing. And now, another lesson that will last a lifetime: how to manage their money. Greenlight gives them their own account, their own card, and the tools to earn, save, and spend wisely — with you guiding every step. Start them right. Greenlight.</p>
<hr class="section-break">
<p class="action">!<strong>DOCUMENTARY/EXPLAINER</strong></p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">At the turn of the first millennium, Rome was the center of the known world — and Augustus, its first emperor, was reshaping it in his image: order, morality, permanence. He understood the power of art — poets like Virgil and Horace helped build the mythology of his reign. So when Ovid, one of Rome’s most celebrated writers, used his pen to mock everything Augustus stood for, the emperor didn’t laugh it off. He banished him to the frozen edge of the empire.</p>
<p class="dialogue">But Ovid didn’t fall silent. In exile, he completed a masterpiece that would outlast Augustus, outlast Rome itself.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The <em>Metamorphoses</em> weaves over 250 myths into a single, continuous poem, all connected by one idea: everything changes. Not just bodies, but gods, empires, the world itself.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Narcissus falls in love with his own reflection and becomes a flower. Daphne escapes a god by turning into a tree. Arachne challenges a goddess and is twisted into a spider. Orpheus sings his way into the underworld — and when he’s torn apart, his severed head floats down the river, still singing.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The poem begins with the creation of the universe and ends with the reign of Augustus — the very emperor who exiled him. Its final word is <em>vivam</em>: “I shall live.” The poet was erased. The poem outlasted the empire.</p>
<hr class="section-break">
<p class="action">!<strong>AUDIOBOOK</strong></p>
<p class="scene-heading">EXT. UNDERWORLD, WHARF — NIGHT</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Benjamin picked his way carefully across the slick cobblestones of a narrow street as the perpetual rain continued to fall in a thin, cold drizzle. He was in a nameless port town, but so far could nowhere find the port. Lanterns burned in the windows with flames that gave no warmth. The dead passed him without a glance — though they swam through an ocean of time, they could barely spare a drop of it to help a lost, living boy.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Benjamin knew his parents were still out there because they appeared in his mind as two faint lights in the endless darkness. He could yet not control his newfound powers, but now and again, they gave him solutions without even being asked.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The only thing the dead would offer, when they spoke with him at all, was to share the rumors—two living people were passing through the Underworld. Apparently it hadn’t happened in at least a thousand years. Nice going, mom and dad.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The houses on the street leaned together like tied, old men. And Benjamin was getting the feeling e that he had passed these buildings before. Which would mean he was going in a circle.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frustration bordering on anger rose in his chest and Benjamin closed his eyes tightly and took a deep breath in. The faint, repulsive odor of the Underworld filled his nose. And when he breathed it out again, his mind was clearer and he had decided he would leave this stupid labyrinth and try somewhere else.</p>
<p class="dialogue">He had already begun to turn around to find his way out, when he suddenly noticed a narrow lane branching off to the left, sloping gently downward. It must lead to the port, where there might be sailors telling stories about all they had seen as they traveled. They might have even seen his parents.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Benjamin had the funny idea that somehow the labyrinth had had second thoughts when he began to leave and showed him this street as a peace offering. He’d seen weirder things down here.</p>
<p class="dialogue">At the water’s edge, the buildings fell away as if a curtain had been drawn back. A grey-green sea stretched to the horizon, and pale shapes moved beneath its surface, slow and distant, like ghosts of submarines.</p>
<p class="dialogue">That was when he heard the music. A guitar, plucked slowly. And a voice—deep and rich, seeming to rise from somewhere underground. The melody was simple, and sad. Benjamin followed it to the end of the wharf, where a figure sat upon a coil of rope, playing.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The figure wore a deep hood that revealed only a large, faintly green nose and two pale, oversized hands moving gently over the strings of an old guitar. A raven perched nearby on a wooden post, watching Benjamin with a single, shining eye.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The music stopped.</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re alive.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The figure set the guitar aside.</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have you wandered far?</p>
<p class="character">BENJAMIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Very far.</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Very far, yes. Most are not so eager to visit us… on purpose.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">He paused, as though listening to something Benjamin could not hear.</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You are looking for your parents.</p>
<p class="character">BENJAMIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know where they are?</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know how to find out.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">One pale hand gestured toward the sea. Out in the gloom, a ship lay at anchor—black hull, black sails, lanterns burning with a sickly green fire.</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Naglfar. Her captain is Bartholomew Roberts. He and his crew possess something that does not belong to them.</p>
<p class="character">BENJAMIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it?</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">An object that allows a skilled practitioner to see what is—no matter how near, or how far. A seeing stone.</p>
<p class="character">BENJAMIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">So if you had it you could tell me where my parents are?</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The figure inclined his head.</p>
<p class="character">BENJAMIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did they steal it from you?</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not from me. From a creature of the deep—older than the world. As long as it had this stone, it slept. The pirates know this, but they took it anyway. They don’t believe. (beat) But disbelief doesn’t make a thing untrue.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">He turned back toward the sea.</p>
<p class="character">BENJAMIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why haven’t you taken it back yourself?</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The raven made a sound that might have been a laugh. The hooded figure simply said:</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was like you, long ago. Fearless and strong. But the stream of time has left me behind and waits now for what <em>you</em> will do. Bring me the stone.</p>
<p class="scene-heading">EXT. UNDERWORLD, PORT — CONTINUOUS</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Benjamin found a boat—little more than a raft fitted with oars—and pushed out across the spectral water. It was warm and thick, more like oil than sea, glowing faintly beneath the surface. He did his best not to imagine what might be moving below.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Naglfar loomed larger as he drew near. A great galleon, ancient and barnacled, its sails hanging limp in the windless air. And then he saw the hull. It was studded with fingernails—thousands of them, yellowed and curling, pressed into the wood like scales. Benjamin grabbed the anchor chain and began to climb.</p>
<hr class="section-break">
<p class="action">!<strong>CHARACTER</strong></p>
<p class="scene-heading">INT. RABBIT’S HOUSE — DAY</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pooh rose from the table and said, in a rather sticky voice:</p>
<p class="character">POOH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Goodbye, Rabbit. I must be going.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And he started out the front door. Pooh’s head reached the outdoors and his feet dangled indoors, but his middle got stuck in the middle.</p>
<p class="character">POOH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bother! It all comes from not having a big enough front door.</p>
<p class="character">RABBIT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nonsense! It all comes from eating too much!</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And he hurried out his back door to fetch Christopher Robin. Pooh spotted Owl sitting on a branch.</p>
<p class="character">OWL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello, Pooh. Are you stuck?</p>
<p class="character">POOH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh no! I’m just resting.</p>
<p class="character">OWL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pooh, you are definitively stuck. You are a wedged bear in a great tightness. This situation calls for an expert!</p>
<p class="character">GOPHER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did someone say expert? Gopher’s my name, digging’s my game. The problem with this door is that it has a bear in it.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And he popped back down into his hole. Before long, Rabbit returned with Christopher Robin.</p>
<p class="character">CHRISTOPHER ROBIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Silly old bear. There is only one thing to do. We will just have to wait for you to get thin!</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eeyore made gloomy predictions about how long it would take.</p>
<p class="character">EEYORE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It could be days. Maybe weeks. Even months.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Rabbit grew tired of seeing Pooh’s bottom where his front door used to be.</p>
<p class="character">RABBIT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, why did I ever invite that bear to lunch!</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Finally, one morning, Rabbit leaned against Pooh’s bottom. It moved.</p>
<p class="character">RABBIT</p>
<p class="dialogue">He budged! Hooray! He bidged! He badged! He boodged! Christopher Robin!</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everyone took hold and pulled, and with a great pop, Pooh sailed through the air and landed headfirst in a honey tree — which was a very good place for a bear to be. That night, back at home, Pooh heard a strange sound at his front door. And being a bear of very little brain, he decided to let the strange sound in. A big, bouncy creature bounded through and knocked Pooh flat on his back.</p>
<p class="character">TIGGER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello! I’m Tigger. T-I-double-guh-Rrr. Glad to meet ya.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And with that, he went bouncing back out the door and into the night.</p>
